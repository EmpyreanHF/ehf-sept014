// MARKETPLACE ESCROW PAYOUT RULE (explicit — do not "helpfully" convert):
// a seller is paid in the EXACT SAME currency the buyer paid in. If the
// buyer paid fiat (NGN/USD/etc, via Flutterwave), the seller is credited
// that same fiat amount — never converted to EMPY. EMPY is only ever
// credited when the order's own currency IS 'EMPY' (i.e. the buyer paid
// with their EMPY balance for that listing), in which case it's a 1:1
// credit, not a rate conversion. See marketplace_orders' `currency`
// field, set at order-creation time directly from the listing's own
// priced currency — that already tells us what the buyer actually paid
// in; no separate "payment method" field is needed.
//
// Fiat credits are tracked in `users/{sellerId}.fiatBalance.<CURRENCY>` —
// a currency-keyed map, kept entirely separate from `empyBalance` so a
// naira sale can never inflate a seller's EMPY balance. NOTE: as of this
// writing there is no withdrawal UI/route wired to fiatBalance yet (the
// existing withdrawal_requests flow — app-patch-v48.js — is EMPY-only).
// Flagging this so it isn't a silent gap: sellers will accumulate a
// correct fiatBalance from marketplace sales, but cashing that out to a
// bank account needs its own withdrawal path, not built here.

// The logo file itself is a static asset — public/logo.png, alongside the

// pointed at it later.
// Two distinct assets, two distinct jobs:
//  - _logoUrl(): small square icon (icon-192.png) used as the <link rel="icon">
//    favicon — this is what WhatsApp/Messenger/Facebook render as the tiny
//    round logo NEXT TO the domain/link text at the bottom of the card
//    (see the reference screenshot: the small "f" badge beside facebook.com).
//  - _fallbackCardUrl(): the big 1200x630 branded card image, used as the
//    og:image ONLY when a post has no media of its own. Previously this
//    fallback was the same small circular logo.png stretched to fill the
//    whole image slot, which is why it looked oversized/plain instead of
//    a proper card — public/og-fallback.jpg is a purpose-built 1200x630
//    graphic (gradient background + centered emblem + wordmark) sized to
//    the exact aspect ratio WhatsApp/Facebook/Twitter expect.

// completely uncompressed. Express does not compress responses on its own;
// without this, `compression` was never even a dependency. Text compresses
// to roughly 20-30% of its original size with gzip, so this alone should
// cut total page-load bytes by 3-5x for every visitor — the single highest-
// leverage fix for the "site won't load" complaints, and it doesn't touch

// ── NEURAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH PROXY (ElevenLabs) ──────────────────────────────
// FEATURE: replaces the robotic OS-installed voice the "🔊 Hear this
// section" voice assistants (Donor Hub / Sponsor a Cause, and the Grant
// Transparency Portal — see index.html's §48/§49 blocks) used to rely on
// exclusively (window.speechSynthesis, whose actual voice quality is
// whatever happens to be installed on the visitor's OS — often noticeably
// robotic). This route generates real, human-sounding narration via
// ElevenLabs' Multilingual v2 model server-side, so the API key never
// reaches the browser (same "secret stays server-side, client only ever
// gets the derived result" pattern already used for Flutterwave's secret
// key and SendGrid's API key elsewhere in this file).
//
// The client falls back to speechSynthesis automatically if this route
// ever fails for any reason (key not configured, ElevenLabs outage, rate
// limit, network error) — see index.html's own try/catch around its
// fetch('/api/tts') call. Nothing else changes if ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is
// left unset: this route just answers 501 and the existing browser-voice
// behavior continues exactly as it did before this feature shipped.
//
// COST CONTROL: the handful of narration texts this feature actually
// serves (one per language, per section — a fixed, small set) are cached
// in memory by a hash of (lang + text), so the very first play of each
// language/section combo is the only one that ever calls the paid

// ── SERVER-SIDE NOTIFY LISTENERS (no client required) ────────────────────
// FIX (feature: "notifications should still go out even if nobody has the
// app open anywhere"): app-push-setup.js's old empyreanPostNotifyTrigger()
// was a Firestore listener that only ran INSIDE A BROWSER TAB — if nobody
// had the app open when a post/SOS/crisis doc was created, nothing fired
// until someone reconnected. This does the same job from inside THIS
// process instead. server.js is a persistent Node process (not a browser
// tab) that already stays running 24/7 on Render's starter plan, already
// has the Firebase Admin SDK credentials loaded (FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_
// JSON, used by /api/notify above), and Admin SDK Firestore listeners run
// with admin privileges — they're not subject to the Firestore security
// rules a browser client would be. So the listener attaches once at boot
// and keeps running for the life of this server, independent of any
// client being connected. No Firebase Blaze plan needed — this isn't a
// Cloud Function, just another listener living in the same server process
// that already sends the pushes.
//
// IMPORTANT: this REPLACES app-push-setup.js's client-side trigger (Part
// 2, empyreanPostNotifyTrigger). That client-side code must stay removed/
// disabled once this is deployed — running both at once double-sends
// every notification. See the matching comment left in app-push-setup.js.
//
// Trade-off vs. a true Cloud Function: this depends on the Render dyno
// itself staying up. Render's starter plan doesn't sleep and restarts are
// rare, but a deploy or platform restart means a few seconds where the
// listener isn't attached — a Cloud Function has stronger uptime
// guarantees than any single server process, at the cost of needing the
// Blaze plan. Revisit if that gap ever matters for something urgent (e.g.
// SOS).

// NOTE: 'statuses' is deliberately NOT in this list -- unlike posts/sos/
// crisis/news/reels (one brand-new Firestore doc per post), a status is ONE
// doc per user (id "status-<uid>") whose `items` array just grows via a
// merge update (see app-status.js's writers). A generic "doc added" watcher
// would only ever fire for someone's very first-ever status and stay silent
// for every one after that, so statuses gets its own listener below
// (_watchStatuses) that diffs items.length instead of doc-added events.
// (Reels DO fit the generic pattern here -- app-fixes.js writes a fresh
// doc per upload via .doc(reelId).set(...); the later .update() calls for
// likes/retweets are 'modified' events, which _watchCollection below
// already ignores, so those don't cause spurious re-notifications.)

// ── SCHEDULED-STREAM REMINDERS (v58 follow-up) ────────────────────────────
// v58's own client-side code (now merged into app-patch-v42.js — see that
// file's own header for the merge/renumbering note) deliberately
// shipped reminders through the in-app bell only, flagging true FCM push as
// a follow-up once /api/notify's contract was known — it's known now (see
// /api/notify above), so this wires the real thing.
//
// Why POLLING on an interval, not onSnapshot like NOTIFY_COLLECTIONS above:
// every other listener in this file fires on a DISCRETE EVENT ("a doc was
// just added"). A reminder fires when a CLOCK reaches a point relative to
// a field already sitting quietly in an existing doc — nothing changes in
// Firestore at the moment a reminder becomes due, so there's no snapshot
// event to hook. Polling once a minute (same cadence the client's own
// _checkReminders already uses) is the correct tool here, not a
// workaround.
//
// DEDUPE: unlike the client's own localStorage-based dedupe (which is
// necessarily per-device), this has to be per-DOCUMENT, because it's the
// one place that pushes to every recipient at once — a Firestore field
// (`reminder15Sent: true`) written back onto the scheduled_streams doc
// itself after sending is the natural place for that, and it means a
// server restart mid-window can never double-send: the field survives
// the restart even though the in-memory poll loop doesn't.
//
// TARGETING NOTE: this reads fcmToken off users/{uid} docs, populated by
// app-push-setup.js's _subscribeToken() passing uid to /api/fcm/subscribe
// (see that route's own comment above) whenever a real logged-in identity
// is available. A user who hasn't opened the app since this shipped, or
// who's only ever used it as a guest, simply has no fcmToken yet —
// admin.messaging().send() then has nothing to send to, and this no-ops
// for that one uid without throwing or blocking any other recipient/

// ── BIRTHDAY FEATURE — daily check + follower push ────────────────────────
// FEATURE: "on the user's birthday, send a push notification to all
// followers, with 'Wish Happy Birthday' and 'Send Gift' CTAs." The birthday
// FRAME itself (auto-applied to the profile picture) is computed purely
// client-side in app-profile.js by comparing today's month-day against the
// profile owner's own dobMonthDay — it needs no server involvement, since
// it's just "is today this specific date," recomputed fresh every time
// that profile renders. The one thing that genuinely needs a server-side
// job is this: reliably firing an OFFLINE push to every follower exactly
// once, which (like the scheduled-stream reminder above) has to run even
// when nobody has the app open anywhere.
//
// QUERY STRATEGY: dobMonthDay ('MM-DD', written once at signup — see
// app-auth.js's newUser object) lets this run a cheap equality query
// instead of pulling every user doc and parsing dates client-side; matters
// once this collection has more than a handful of users. Same reasoning
// FCM_BROADCAST_TOPIC's "topic" isn't used here as followedUserIds's own
// array-contains query below.
//
// FOLLOWER LOOKUP: there's no separate reverse-index "followers" table in
// this schema — but every user doc already stores its OWN followedUserIds
// array (see app-fixes.js's follow-button handler), so
// `where('followedUserIds', 'array-contains', birthdayUserId)` finds
// exactly the set of people who follow that user, with no schema change.
//
// FREQUENCY GUARD: lastBirthdayCelebratedYear (set on the user doc itself,
// survives a server restart) — same "mark handled before acting, so a
// mid-loop restart can't double-send" discipline
// _checkScheduledStreamReminders already uses above, just per-year instead

// ── /api/promotion/boost/confirm ── Verified Fiat-funded post boost ───────
// ADDED (2026-08-08): closes the exact gap app-fixes.js's own comment used
// to flag next to its post-boost card-payment FlutterwaveCheckout call —
// that path used to activate a promotion straight off Flutterwave's
// CLIENT-SIDE "successful" callback, with no server check a charge ever
// happened. Mirrors /api/promotion/confirm (business campaigns, just
// above) and /api/marketplace/order/confirm exactly: re-verifies the SAME
// tx_ref server-side via _verifyFlwTxRef() before writing anything.
//
// Separate route (and separate doc-id prefix, promo-boost-*) from
// /api/promotion/confirm rather than a shared one — the two write
// genuinely different document shapes into the same `promotions`
// collection (this one is postId/budgetNGN-keyed, matching
// app-live.js's registerPromotion() exactly; the business-campaign one is
// pageId/dailyBudget-keyed) and conflating them would risk one route's
// validation silently accepting the other shape's fields.
//
// budgetNGN is taken from Flutterwave's OWN confirmed charged amount —
// never from a client-submitted budget — so a manipulated request can't
// activate a bigger boost than was actually paid for. The doc shape below
// matches registerPromotion()'s own output field-for-field so the existing
// feed-ranking budgetScore formula (app-live.js's scorePost()) keeps
// working unchanged for fiat-funded boosts, same as it already does for
// wallet-funded ones.

// =============================================================================
// BACKGROUND: firebase-rules.js's isEmpyBalanceCreditOnlyUpdate/
// isLiveIncomeOnlyUpdate rules cap and direction-check CROSS-user credit
// writes, but the general owner rule further down (`allow write: if
// request.auth.uid == userId`) still let a signed-in client write ANY value
// into its OWN empyBalance directly — no cap, no direction check — because
// that rule doesn't scope which fields it covers. That's the actual "type
// one command in devtools, become a billionaire" hole, and every legitimate
// self-credit flow in the app (rank rewards, impact-mining task/action
// rewards, P2P listing-cancel refunds) was ALSO relying on that same
// unrestricted rule to write its own reward locally. Closing the hole and
// keeping those features working can't be done in firebase-rules.js alone
// — it means moving the actual crediting to server-side Admin SDK writes
// (which bypass client rules entirely and can enforce real business logic:
// reward tables, one-time-only checks, daily pool budgets) and then, only
// once that's done, tightening the client rule so it can no longer
// INCREASE its own empyBalance directly at all (see the matching
// firebase-rules.js diff shipped alongside this file — isSelfEmpyBalanceSafe).
// Decreases (spending EMPY on a gift, staking, listing something for sale,
// a wallet transfer send, etc.) are untouched — those are safe to leave
// client-writable and are not part of this migration.
//
// Auth/trust model: matches this codebase's existing convention for
// user-level (non-admin) money routes — see confirm-receipt/mark-dispatched
// above, which trust a client-supplied id checked against the field
// actually stored on the target document, rather than a bearer ID token.
// These five routes follow the same pattern; none of them trust a
// client-supplied REWARD AMOUNT, only a client-supplied identity, which is
// then checked against server-held state before anything is credited.
//
// CLIENT WIRING STATUS (2026-07-31, completion pass): all five routes above
// now have their client call sites migrated too — app-fixes.js's rank-
// reward and community-task claims, app-impactmining.js's _processReward
// (the 5 non-premium self-mining actions: SUCCESSFUL_ESCROW_SELLER/BUYER,
// SHARE_POST, RETWEET_POST, SEND_GIFT — see that file's own comment for why
// the 9 PREMIUM 60/40-split actions are NOT migrated here), and
// app-p2p-trading.js's _p2pCancelListing/_p2pReleaseEscrow. app-wallet.js's
// buy-empy-form (Flutterwave card purchase) was also found to be
// self-crediting directly from its own client-side payment callback — not
// one of the original five, but the same class of bug — and is now wired to
// this file's existing /api/wallet/confirm-purchase instead.
//
// STAKING — NOW BUILT (2026-07-31, follow-up to the completion pass above).
// app-wallet.js's stake-form/unstake-form/claim-reward-btn and
// simulateRewardAccrual()'s locked-staking release used to run on pure
// client-side numbers (manualStakedBalance/lockedStakedBalance/
// earnedRewards) with no Firestore-backed ledger at all — except the claim
// itself, which DID persist straight to empyBalance via a direct client
// write once tapped, from a client-computed "earned" figure a user could
// set to anything via devtools first. That's now closed: users/{userId}
// gains five new server-only fields (manualStakedBalance,
// lockedStakedBalance, lockedStakingEndTime, stakingEarnedRewards,
// stakingLastAccrualAt), computeStakingAccrual() below is the ONLY thing
// that ever advances stakingEarnedRewards or releases a matured lock, and
// four new endpoints (/api/staking/stake, /unstake, /claim-rewards, /sync)
// are the ONLY way any of those five fields change — see
// firebase-rules.js's touchesServerOnlyStakingFields, which blocks the
// client from writing any of them directly, same as empyBalance increases.
//
// STILL NOT covered by this: the 9 PREMIUM 60/40-split impact-mining
// actions (CREATE_POST, CREATE_REEL, PUBLISH_NEWS, LIVE_STREAM_INTERVAL,
// VERIFIED_CRISIS_REPORT, VERIFIED_SOS_REQUEST, SUCCESSFUL_REFERRAL,
// GUEST_JOINED_LIVE, HOST_INVITED_GUEST) still self-credit their 60%
// withdrawable portion via a direct client write, and their 40% locked
// portion was never persisted anywhere (see app-impactmining.js's own
// comment). Now that lockedStakedBalance/lockedStakingEndTime exist and
// are real, wiring those 9 actions to deposit their 40% here too — and
// crediting their 60% via claim-mining-reward instead of direct-write — is
// the natural next step, but is its own scoped change (needs
// claim-mining-reward to support a split credit), not bundled into this
// one. Because those 9 actions still self-credit directly,
// firebase-rules.js's general owner-write rule remains the CAPPED
// mitigation (isSelfEmpyBalanceNonIncreasing), not an outright ban — see
// that function's own comment.

// Mirrors app-state.js's own STAKING_APY_ESTIMATE / STAKING_LOCK_DURATION —
// the ONLY values used to compute a staking reward or a lock window
// server-side; the client never gets to submit its own accrual number or
// its own lock end time.
const STAKING_APY_ESTIMATE  = 0.157; // 15.7 %, matches the staking UI's own label
const STAKING_LOCK_DURATION = 6 * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 6 months — for the day a locked deposit is created here too (see comment above)

// Recomputes a user's staking fields up to `now` from their currently
// stored doc — a pure function, no I/O, so every staking endpoint below
// calls it right after its own transaction's read and before applying
// whatever action-specific delta (stake/unstake/claim) it's handling.
// Two things happen here, independent of which endpoint called it:
//   1. Continuous APY accrual on manualStakedBalance, added to
//      stakingEarnedRewards (uncapped — it keeps growing until claimed,
//      same as the old client-side simulateRewardAccrual did).
//   2. Auto-release of lockedStakedBalance into empyBalance once
//      lockedStakingEndTime has passed (mirrors that same function's old
//      client-side auto-release — now happens here, the moment ANY
//      staking endpoint is next called, instead of on a client-side
//      per-second timer with no server involved at all).
// Nothing currently WRITES lockedStakedBalance for any user (the premium
// impact-mining reward's 40% lock split is still on the old
// client-authoritative direct-write path — see the SELF_MINING_ACTIONS
// comment above) — this function is already correct for the day that
// split gets migrated here too.

// table) — a client claiming "I liked this post, pay its owner" can't be
// trusted the same way a client claiming "I just created a post, pay ME"
// can (the latter is at least verifiable as "did this account's own write
// succeed"; the former requires trusting an unverifiable third-party
// claim). Instead of a client-called claim endpoint, these are credited
// automatically by startLikeCommentRewardListeners() below, which watches
// Firestore directly via the Admin SDK for a like/comment that ACTUALLY
// happened (a likedBy array gaining a new uid, confirmed by Firestore's
// own isToggleField/isOneTimeField-gated write rules — see
// firebase-rules.js — so this can't be forged by a client either) and
// credits the real owner the moment it's observed. See _creditReceiveReward
// and the listener functions further down this file.
// RETIRED (2026-08-15 — engagement-attribution fix): this used to pay the
// post/comment OWNER every time someone else liked/commented on their
// content. Two problems with that: (1) wrong side of the interaction — the

// in SELF_MINING_ACTIONS above); the "Receive a Like/Comment" forecast rate
// belongs to whoever performs the like/comment, not whoever receives it a
// second time — that's now ENGAGE_LIKE/ENGAGE_COMMENT in SELF_MINING_ACTIONS
// above. (2) receiving engagement is a creator-monetization concern, not an
// impact-mining one — app-monetization.js's computeEngagement() already
// reads a creator's total likes/commentCount/shareCount straight off their
// posts to gate their payout tier/eligibility, so a creator already gets
// real payout upside from receiving likes/comments through that system.
// Paying it again here, per-event, out of the mining pool was duplicate
// credit through the wrong channel. Left as an empty object (not deleted)
// per this codebase's own convention, and because _creditReceiveReward
// below still references it defensively — see startLikeCommentRewardListeners()

// here was duplicate credit through the mining pool). RECEIVE_MINING_ACTIONS

// deliberately-designed monetization payout ever wants this same
// observed-Firestore-diff pattern (it would need to credit a monetization

// _creditReceiveReward() is the shared crediting function both listener

// ── startLikeCommentRewardListeners() — RETIRED 2026-08-15, see below ──
// The notes in this comment block (SCOPE / COST NOTE / SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT)
// describe how this function used to behave when it was live. It no longer
// runs — see the RETIRED note right above _creditReceiveReward, and the
// early `return` at the top of the function itself. Kept for anyone
// designing a real, monetization-side replacement later: the same
// Watches-Firestore-directly / diff-likedBy / SCOPE / COST-NOTE /
// SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT shape would still apply to that, just crediting a
// monetization ledger instead of empyBalance.
//
// Watched Firestore directly (Admin SDK — bypasses firestore.rules, same
// as every other server-side listener in this file) for two things:
//   1. A post's `likedBy` array gaining a NEW uid  -> credited the post's
//      OWNER (data.userId) RECEIVE_LIKE, once ever per (post, liker) pair.
//   2. A NEW document appearing in any `comments` subcollection -> credited
//      the PARENT POST's owner RECEIVE_COMMENT, once ever per comment.
//      (If a comment document itself ever grows a `likedBy` array too,
//      the same diffing was applied there as a bonus — costs nothing if
//      that field never appears on comments in practice.)
//
// SCOPE (deliberate, first pass, back when this was live): only the
// top-level `posts` collection and its `comments` subcollection were
// covered. reels/news_posts/business_posts/etc. have their own likedBy
// fields too (per firebase-rules.js's shared isValidEngagementChange
// helper) but were never wired up here — moot now that receiving a
// like/comment doesn't pay EMPY at all, from any collection.
//
// COST NOTE: this attached a SEPARATE onSnapshot listener to the whole
// `posts` collection and to collectionGroup('comments'), on top of the
// existing top-5-only listener _watchCollection() already has on `posts`
// for push notifications. That meant every post document was read by two
// independent listeners instead of one — accepted at the time as the same
// "additive, don't touch the working thing" tradeoff this codebase makes
// elsewhere (see e.g. app-patch-v39's own header). Moot now that the
// listener never attaches.
//
// SKIP-FIRST-SNAPSHOT: mirrored _watchCollection()'s own reasoning for
// exactly the same problem — a freshly (re)attached listener's first
// callback reports EVERY existing document as if it just changed. Without
// a guard, every restart would have re-diffed (and, without the
// receipt-doc idempotency check, re-credited) every like/comment that ever
// existed. The receipt-doc check in _creditReceiveReward was the real
// safety net; this flag only avoided needlessly attempting (and logging)
// thousands of already-credited transactions on every boot. Moot now.

// ── /api/marketplace/order/:id/confirm-receipt ── Buyer releases escrow ──
// Called when the buyer taps "Confirm Receipt" (client UI added in
// app-marketplace.js / app-marketplace-sellers.js's Orders pane). Flips
// status 'paid'/'dispatched' -> 'released' AND, atomically in the same
// Firestore transaction, credits the seller — in the SAME currency the
// buyer paid, per marketplace_orders' own `currency` field (set at
// order-creation time directly from the listing's priced currency, which
// is what Flutterwave actually charged the buyer in): fiat stays fiat
// (users/{sellerId}.fiatBalance.<CURRENCY>, a currency-keyed map, kept
// fully separate from empyBalance), and EMPY is only ever credited when
// the order's currency IS 'EMPY' — a 1:1 credit in that case, never a
// rate conversion. Also logs an entry into the existing `transactions`
// collection (same shape app-tokenpurchase.js's own purchase-callback
// already writes there), so this shows up in whatever transaction-
// history UI already reads that collection.
//
// Everything below happens inside ONE db.runTransaction() — the status
// flip, the balance credit, and the log write either all commit together
// or none do. This also closes a real correctness gap a naive get-then-
// update version of this route would have: two near-simultaneous
// confirm-receipt calls for the same order could both pass the "not yet
// released" check before either write landed, crediting the seller
// twice. A Firestore transaction can't do that — the second call's read
// is guaranteed to see the first call's write (or the transaction
// retries), so the status re-check happens under an actual lock.
//
// Fails safe rather than guessing: a zero/invalid order amount or a
// seller account that doesn't exist results in the order still being
// marked 'released' (the buyer's confirmation is honored either way —
// they shouldn't be stuck mid-flow over a crediting edge case) but
// WITHOUT a balance credit, flagged via `creditFailed`/
// `creditFailedReason` on the order doc for manual reconciliation, and
// reflected honestly in the seller's email (see email-templates.js's
// escrowSellerReleasedEmailTemplate).
//

// operate at (no server-side session/idToken check exists anywhere else

// AGORA CLOUD RECORDING — server-side, multi-participant composited
// replay (upgrade over v57's honestly-scoped host-device-only recording).
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Three Agora REST calls are involved, all authenticated with Basic auth
// built from a Customer ID/Secret pair (RESTful API credentials — a
// DIFFERENT credential pair from the App ID/App Certificate used for RTC
// tokens above, generated separately in Agora Console → RESTful API):
//   1. acquire   — reserve a resourceId for a (channel, uid) pair
//   2. start     — begin composited "mix mode" recording against that
//                  resourceId, writing straight to a third-party cloud
//                  storage bucket (Agora does not hold the files itself)
//   3. stop      — end recording, returns the fileList that landed in
//                  that bucket
// The recording joins the channel as its own dedicated Agora participant
// (a fixed bot uid, subscribing to every publisher — host, promoted
// guests, everyone) — this is precisely what closes v57's own documented
// gap ("doesn't composite in guest-broadcaster video/audio").
//
// STATE ACROSS acquire → start → stop: Agora requires the exact same
// resourceId + sid on the stop call that acquire/start returned. Kept in
// an in-memory Map (this server process stays up between those calls for
// any realistic stream length) AND mirrored to a `live_recordings/
// {channelName}` Firestore doc via the Admin SDK, purely as a crash-
// recovery backup — if this Render process restarts mid-recording, the
// in-memory Map is gone, but the Firestore doc still has enough (resourceId,
// sid, uid, channelName) for a manual/future recovery stop call, same
// "state that must survive a restart goes to Firestore, not memory alone"
// discipline the scheduled-stream reminder dedupe above already follows.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// AD REVENUE SHARE — Content Creator Monetization Model (server-side)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FIX (2026-08, follow-up to app-monetization.js §14): the first pass of
// this feature computed everything client-side against a made-up
// perViewUsd constant, had no bridge to a real, withdrawable balance, and
// relied only on Firestore's "admin can write" rule to keep the ledger
// honest. All three are fixed here:
//   1. perViewUsd was fictional — nothing backed the dollar figure a
//      creator saw. Now an admin enters the REAL ad revenue figure for a
//      period (whatever an actual ad network/partner pays this platform)
//      via /set-pool, and every creator's share is a proportional cut of
//      THAT real number, weighted by their share of total platform
//      engagement that period.
//   2. There was no path from the ledger to real money. /request-payout
//      moves a creator's available (unpaid) balance into the existing
//      withdrawal_queue collection — the same collection and the same
//      admin review flow app-monetization.js's EMPY withdrawal form
//      already uses.
//   3. Computation ran in the browser; only a Firestore rule stood
//      between a client and a fabricated ledger entry. Every number here
//      is now computed from `posts`/`users` server-side via the Admin
//      SDK, and firebase-rules.js denies ALL client writes to
//      ad_revenue_shares/ad_revenue_quarterly_reports/
//      ad_revenue_program_meta outright (`if false`) — the client can
//      only read what this file already wrote. Per-period idempotency
//      (lastPeriodKey) stops a second run of the same period from
//      double-crediting, and a trailing-average anomaly check withholds
//      credit (flags for review instead) on an obvious view-stuffing
//      spike rather than paying it out automatically.

// ── /api/admin/media-migration ── Cloudinary -> Firebase Storage ──────────
// One-off (repeatable/idempotent) background job for the 2026-08 Cloudinary
// stall: old posts/reels/statuses/etc still hold `https://res.cloudinary.com/
// dxwmts9vw/...` URLs from before the Blaze-plan switch to Firebase Storage
// (see app-dom.js's uploadToCloudinary — new uploads already go to Storage;
// this route is ONLY for the historical URLs already sitting in Firestore).
//
// Deliberately NOT a fixed per-collection field list (posts.mediaUrl,
// reels.videoUrl, etc.) — this codebase has ~30+ collections and several
// (chats/{id}/msgs, comments/replies) are nested subcollections reachable
// only via collectionGroup(). Instead this deep-scans every field of every
// doc in the configured targets for any string containing a Cloudinary URL,
// wherever it's nested (works for arrays of attachments, {url, thumb} maps,
// etc. with zero schema knowledge). Firestore Timestamp/GeoPoint values are
// left untouched (they have no cloudinary content and recursing into their
// internals would break them).
//
// Flow: POST /start kicks off an in-memory job (same pattern as bulk-
// disburse-routes.js's _batches Map) and returns immediately; the job then
// (1) scans all targets and collects every distinct Cloudinary URL found,
// (2) downloads + re-uploads each DISTINCT url exactly once (so a thumbnail
// reused across 40 posts is only migrated once), (3) re-walks each affected
// doc and writes back only the top-level fields that actually changed.
// GET /:id/status polls progress. A urlsFailed entry (bad/expired Cloudinary
// URL — the account being on a stalled plan may mean SOME assets are truly
// gone) leaves that one field's URL untouched rather than blanking it, so a
// failed migration never destroys a working reference by accident.
//
// Uploaded files get a `firebaseStorageDownloadTokens` metadata value and a
// hand-built https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/... URL — the exact
// format admin.storage()'s Node SDK doesn't return directly but Firebase's
// own client getDownloadURL() calls produce — so every migrated URL plays
// back through the existing <video>/<img> tags with zero frontend changes.

// ── FREE-TIER KEEP-ALIVE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// FIX (root cause of "push notifications work once, then stop for good" on
// Render's Free plan): Free-tier services spin down after ~15 minutes with
// no INCOMING HTTP request. A new Firestore doc being created does NOT
// count as traffic to this server — Firestore talks to Google's servers,
// not to this dyno — so the exact moment a user creates a post is exactly
// the moment this process is most likely to be asleep, with the
// _watchCollection/_watchStatuses listeners above not running at all (a
// sleeping dyno doesn't run JS, so reconnect logic can't save it either —
// this needs a different fix than the listener-reconnect one above).
//
// The standard, no-cost workaround: have the server hit its OWN public URL
// on an interval shorter than the spin-down window, so Render always sees
// recent inbound traffic and never considers this dyno idle in the first
// place. This does NOT wake an already-sleeping dyno (a sleeping process
// runs no code, so it can't fire its own timer) — it only works by making
// sure the dyno never falls asleep to begin with, which is sufficient as
// long as the interval below stays comfortably under 15 minutes and this
// process itself never crashes/redeploys and sits dead for a stretch first.
// If it DOES go to sleep before this ships (or after a deploy), the very
// next real visitor's page load is what wakes it back up, same as today.
//
// Pings /api/config specifically — it's the same lightweight route
// render.yaml already uses as healthCheckPath, does no Firestore read, and
// req.protocol/host don't matter here since RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL already IS
// this service's full public https URL.
//
// Deliberately does nothing outside Render (no RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL means
// local dev, or a host that doesn't need this trick) — so this is a no-op
// everywhere except where it's actually needed.
