/* =============================================================================
   EMPYREAN INTERNATIONAL — app-patch-group-call.js
   Load order: AFTER app-patch-v13.js (needs window.openGroupChat's header
   buttons/banner already wired to call window._empGroupCallStart, which
   this file defines) and AFTER app-patch-openchat.js (not a hard runtime
   dependency, just keeps load order consistent with the rest of the
   messaging feature area).

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES
   Real group video/voice calling for a group chat — genuinely working
   WebRTC media between every participant, not a UI stub. One call can be
   active per group at a time; anyone in the group can start or join it.

   WHY A NEW FILE INSTEAD OF EDITING app-patch-openchat.js's CALL CODE
   app-patch-openchat.js's entire RTC module (_rtc state, _createPC,
   _startCallModal, etc.) is built around exactly ONE remote peer — one
   RTCPeerConnection, one offer, one answer, one pair of candidate
   subcollections. A group call needs an independent RTCPeerConnection
   PER OTHER PARTICIPANT (mesh topology) plus presence tracking for
   people joining/leaving mid-call, which is a different shape of state
   machine, not a parameter tweak on the 1:1 one. Reusing the naming
   conventions and Firestore signaling pattern (offer/answer doc +
   candidate subcollections, same ICE_SERVERS) keeps it consistent with
   the rest of the app without forcing an unrelated rewrite of working
   1:1 calling code.

   TOPOLOGY: full mesh. Every participant holds one RTCPeerConnection per
   OTHER participant. Fine for small groups (this app's group chats cap
   at a handful of members per the New Group picker in app-patch-v13.js);
   would need an SFU to scale to large rooms, which is a separate,
   larger infrastructure decision, not something to silently swap in
   here. Hard-capped at MAX_CALL_PARTICIPANTS (10) below — the grid is
   designed to hold that many tiles, and mesh WebRTC gets expensive fast
   past that, so joining (and adding people mid-call) is refused once full.

   MID-CALL FEATURES
   - Add people: the header "add" button reads groups/{groupId}.members,
     offers everyone not already on the call, and — since there's no
     invite/ring collection for group calls — posts a system message into
     the group's own message thread ("X added Y to the call") using the
     EXISTING groups/{groupId}/messages rule. Anyone with the group chat
     open already sees the live "call in progress" banner
     (app-patch-v13.js's _wireGroupCallEntry), so the system message is
     the notification; no new Firestore collection/rule needed for this.
   - Voice → video switch: escalates the whole call's `type` to 'video'
     (group_calls/{groupId}.type), turns on the switcher's own camera, and
     renegotiates every existing RTCPeerConnection by adding the video
     track and creating a FRESH signals/{from_to_r<ts>} doc per peer —
     a new doc id rather than overwriting the original offer/answer doc,
     because _watchIncomingSignals only reacts to 'added' doc-changes
     (matching how it already ignores 'modified' on the original
     offer/answer exchange). Other participants' cameras stay off until
     they individually tap the camera button that appears once the call
     becomes 'video' — the switch only guarantees video is NOW POSSIBLE
     for the call, not that everyone's camera turns on.

   DATA MODEL (new — needs matching Firestore rules, see NOTE at bottom)
     group_calls/{groupId}                    { status:'active'|'ended',
                                                  type:'video'|'voice',
                                                  startedBy, startedAt,
                                                  activeCount }
     group_calls/{groupId}/peers/{uid}         { name, avatar, joinedAt,
                                                  muted, camOff }
     group_calls/{groupId}/signals/{from_to}   { from, to, offer:{type,sdp},
                                                  answer:{type,sdp}, createdAt }
     group_calls/{groupId}/signals/{from_to}/candidates/{auto}
                                                { candidate, sdpMid,
                                                  sdpMLineIndex, from }

   IDENTITY: every doc here is keyed by the REAL Firebase Auth uid
   (fbAuth.currentUser.uid), not userState.id — the same deliberate
   choice app-patch-openchat.js's 1:1 calls collection already makes
   (see its _syncUidIfNeeded/_startCallModal), specifically so this
   feature area sidesteps the userState.id-vs-auth.uid mismatch this
   codebase otherwise works around everywhere else. If there's no live
   auth session, this refuses to start/join rather than writing under
   a stale/wrong id.

       what app-patch-openchat.js's own _notify already documented and
       fixed for the 1:1 call code (window.showNotification only
       registers itself onto window the first time something ELSE in
       app-fixes.js happens to call it, and even once registered it
       silently no-ops if #reward-notification isn't in the DOM). Every
       one of window._empGroupCallStart's early-return guards below (no
       internet, please sign in again, already on another call, not
       supported) depends on this function to tell the person WHY nothing
       happened — a console-only fallback means those guards fire

       exactly like "clicking just blinks with no response." Now verifies

       for that field changing on MY OWN doc, so a host tapping "mute for
       everyone" wrote the field successfully but the targeted person's mic
       never actually turned off; only the host's optimistic local button

       my own track off exactly like tapping the self-mute button, so

       group call is a full mesh — the new track has to be pushed onto
       EVERY peer connection's video sender via replaceTrack, not just
       one, or only some participants would see the flipped feed.
       Mirrors app-patch-openchat.js's _wireCamFlip retry-after-stop

    /* FIX (2026-08-01 — "camera switch doesn't work or respond on time"):
       two compounding problems, both now fixed:
       1) This used to request the new-facing camera BEFORE releasing the
          current one, on every tap. Most Android camera pipelines only
          expose the hardware to one active getUserMedia video track at a
          time, so that first request reliably failed and only the retry
          (after stopping the old track) succeeded — a guaranteed extra
          failed round trip on every single flip, which is what read as
          "doesn't respond on time". Now the old video track is stopped
          up front, so the common case succeeds on the FIRST request; the
          retry below stays only as a safety net for the rare device
          where that still isn't enough.
       2) There was no guard against a second tap while a flip was still
          in flight — and since step 1 made every flip take a visible
          moment, a re-tap (very likely from someone who assumed the
          first tap "didn't work") fired a second overlapping
          getUserMedia/replaceTrack chain against the same _gc.localStream,
          which is exactly the kind of race that made the button feel
          broken. _gcFlipInFlight now makes a second tap a no-op until the
          first flip settles, and the button itself dims/disables for

           — read from the tapping person's side as "stuck". Now every
           peer whose sender was actually removed gets a real

    /* FIX (2026-08-01 — "End doesn't end the call for everyone"): this used
       to only mark group_calls/{groupId}.status:'ended' once the LEAVING
       person happened to be the last peer left — anyone else who tapped
       the same hangup button while other participants were still on the
       call just quietly removed their own peer doc and decremented
       activeCount, leaving the call doc (and therefore the "call in
       progress" banner + everyone else's call screen) fully alive. That's
       "Leave" behavior, not "End" — the button only ever has one label/icon
       (hangup) and no separate "end for everyone" action, so per the
       reported expectation it should always end the call for every
       participant, not just remove the tapper. Now every non-remote leave
       (i.e. an actual tap on the hangup button, not a reaction to someone
       ELSE having already ended it) unconditionally sets status:'ended' —
       every other participant's own _gc.unsubCallDoc listener (set up by
       their own _joinCall) picks that up and runs their own _leaveCall(true)
       to clean up on their side. The write's failure is also now surfaced
       instead of silently swallowed — a permission-denied here means the
       call doc genuinely never ends for anyone, which is exactly the "stuck
       call in progress" bug and needs to be visible, not hidden. */
    /* =========================================================================
       §9 — CALL RECORDING (2026-08-01, new feature — group calls had none
       at all; the 1:1 call in app-patch-openchat.js already has this).
       Mirrors that file's _startRecording/_stopRecording approach — mix
       every audio source through the Web Audio API into one track, and
       for video calls also composite every visible tile onto a hidden
       canvas — but generalized from exactly two parties to however many
       are in _gc.peers right now.

       Deliberately NOT gated to the host only: any participant can start
       or stop it, same "anyone can record" model group-call products
       typically use, since Firestore rules here have no reliable way to
       verify a special "host" identity (see isGroupAdmin's own comment in
       firebase-rules.js on this app's id-space mismatch). What IS added
       for transparency: group_calls/{groupId}.recordingBy is written
       while a recording is active (cleared when it stops), and every
       OTHER participant's existing call-doc listener (in _joinCall) shows
       the "Recording" header note the instant that field is set — nobody
       is recorded without everyone in the call being able to see it's
       happening. No new Firestore rule is needed: group_calls/{groupId}
       already allows `update` for any authenticated call member.

           actual groups — silently, with no error, since an empty
           result set isn't a permission failure. No group's call-doc
           listener was ever attached, so nobody's device could ever
           show the incoming-call banner or play the ring tone,
           regardless of anything else in this file. Still requires a
           live auth session to actually read Firestore (_fbOk() +
           _authUid() below), just no longer uses that uid as the
           membership key itself. */

    // subscribes, but the subscription itself is never re-created after
    // that. If this device's live Firebase Auth uid later changes — the
    // anonymous-session-to-real-login transition this codebase's own
    // patch history (app-patch-v12.js/v26.js/v31.js) documents extensively
    // — the groups/{groupId} array-contains query stays bound to the OLD
    // uid's now-superseded auth context, and the next reconnect Firestore
    // does under the hood permission-denies it. Tearing the listener down
    // and re-running _initIncomingCallWatcher() whenever the uid actually
    // changes (not on every auth event — anonymous sign-in firing once at
    // boot shouldn't cause a pointless resubscribe) keeps the
    // subscription's auth context in sync with whichever uid is live.
