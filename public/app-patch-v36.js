   EMPYREAN INTERNATIONAL — PATCH v36
   app-patch-v36.js  |  Load LAST — after app-patch-v35.js (and therefore after
   app-chat.js, app-patch-openchat.js, app-patch-v12.js, app-fixes.js)

   FIXES TWO REPORTED ISSUES:

   ISSUE #1 — Contact list permanently stuck on "Tap to start a conversation"
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   REV.1 MISTAKE (what shipped first, and why it visibly changed nothing):
     Rev.1 assumed this was a TIMING problem — that _syncLastMessagePreview()
     in app-chat.js (a one-shot Firestore .get() against
     `messages/{tid}/msgs` ordered by a `ts` field) simply lost the race
     against Firebase Auth settling, so rev.1 just re-ran
     window.renderContactList() again once auth was confirmed ready.

     That re-run genuinely happens (visible in console as "[V36]
     renderContactList() re-run after empyrean:auth-ready..."), but the
     rows still show the placeholder, because auth timing was never the
     real problem.

   ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE (confirmed by reading every write path in the app):
     _syncLastMessagePreview queries a collection PATH the live chat
     system doesn't write to. The real, currently-active send path —
     app-patch-openchat.js's _doSend() (~line 4319) — writes each message
     as a FLAT doc: `messages/{msgId}` with fields senderId / receiverId /
     text / createdAt (ISO string). It never touches `messages/{tid}/msgs`
     or a field called `ts` at all. So _syncLastMessagePreview's query
     against that dead path returns an empty snapshot on every single
     call, no matter how many times or how late it's re-run — re-running
     a query that's structurally looking in the wrong place changes
     nothing, which is exactly what was reported.

     app-patch-openchat.js's _doSend() DOES, however, also keep a
     `chats/{chatId}` doc up to date on every send (merge:true):
         { participants, lastMessage, lastMessageTime, lastSenderId }
     — a doc built for exactly this "what's the last message in this
     thread" use case, already proven readable via plain .get() elsewhere
     in that same file (_loadChatFlags, ~line 1827). It was just never
     wired into the contact list.

   FIX (rev.2):
     Keep rev.1's auth-ready re-render (harmless, still useful as a cheap
     safety net) and ADD the actual fix: wrap window.renderContactList so
     that every time it runs, this patch attaches a live onSnapshot
     listener straight to `chats/{chatId}` for each visible contact row —
     the SAME doc the real send path keeps current — and writes
     lastMessage / lastMessageTime directly onto that row the moment the
     doc updates. Listeners are cached per uid (no duplicate subscriptions
     on repeated re-renders) and torn down when a row leaves the list.

   REV.2 GAP (why it "worked, then reverted back to the bug"):
     rev.2's paint only ran inside the onSnapshot callback — i.e. only
     when the chats/{chatId} doc itself changed. But renderContactList()
     is called constantly from all over the app (message-sent handlers,
     incoming-message listeners, app-fix-final.js's own refresh loop —
     8+ call sites) and EVERY call fully rebuilds every .contact-item row
     from scratch, straight back to the localStorage-only placeholder
     text. The very first paint looked correct, but the next unrelated
     renderContactList() call (no new message involved, just some other
     UI event elsewhere) silently rebuilt the row back to the placeholder
     — and since nothing had changed in Firestore, the listener never
     fired again to fix it a second time.

   FIX (rev.3):
     Cache the last-known {lastMessage, lastMessageTime} per contact and
     reapply it to that contact's row on EVERY render pass — not only
     when a fresh Firestore snapshot arrives. This is a pure, cheap DOM
     write (no network call), so running it on every pass is safe, and it
     closes the gap rev.2 left: however many times renderContactList()
     rebuilds the list in the background, the very next pass immediately
     repaints every row from cache before the person ever sees the
     placeholder flash back.

   ISSUE #2 — Chat header / message background redesign
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The live 1:1 chat header and message canvas are built by
   app-patch-openchat.js (#oc-chat-header, #oc-peer-avatar, #oc-peer-name,
   #oc-peer-status, .oc-header-btn, #oc-messages-body) — NOT by the older
   #chat-header-info premium styles in app-chat.js, which target an id
   that app-patch-openchat.js's own cv.innerHTML reset+rebuild bypasses
   entirely (dead CSS, confirmed by grep: no live element ever carries
   the `chat-header-premium` / `chat-bg-premium` classes it styles).

   This patch re-skins the REAL, currently-rendered header/background
   elements in place — no DOM rebuild, so it can't fight
   app-patch-openchat.js's own header-close/back-button wiring.

   rev.4 shipped a deep-navy/indigo + gold-hairline look. rev.5 (below)
   replaces that with the requested "Elegant White + Gold, curvy/premium"
   direction — same in-place re-skin strategy, just a different palette
   and shape:
     • #oc-cl-header / #oc-chat-header: ivory/white gradient with a gold
       hairline + curved bottom corners, replacing the navy fill.
     • #oc-cl-back-btn / #oc-cl-menu-btn / #oc-back-btn / .oc-header-btn:
       cream glass chips with a gold ring and navy icon glyphs (their SVG
       fill/stroke is repainted here too — the old white glyphs would be
       invisible once the header background went light).
     • #oc-peer-avatar / .contact-row-avatar / #v8-quick-contacts img:
       circles → soft "squircles" (curvy rounded-squares) with a slim
       gold ring + lift shadow instead of a flat border. The live-
       broadcast red ring stays untouched on purpose — it's a different
       signal (currently streaming) and shouldn't blur into the gold
       accent colour.
     • #oc-peer-name / #oc-peer-status: recoloured for contrast on the
       now-light header, live status dot unchanged (pulses on "online").
     • #oc-messages-body / .oc-tick: unchanged from rev.4 — still the
       soft ivory/lavender wallpaper and premium tick re-skin described
       below.
   Pure CSS, appended to <head> after every other stylesheet in the load
   order, so equal-specificity id/class rules here win the cascade without
   needing !important on most declarations (only the properties the
   inline-styled elements themselves set need it).

   ISSUE #3 — Voice→video switch: other person accepts, but video never appears
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ROOT CAUSE (confirmed by reading app-patch-openchat.js's own renegotiation
   handler):
     app-patch-openchat.js:2816, inside `_rtc.onVideoSwitchSnapshot`:

         if (data.videoSwitchAnswer && _rtc.videoSwitchAwaitingAnswer) {
             _rtc.videoSwitchAwaitingAnswer = false;
             if (_rtc.pc && !_rtc.pc.currentRemoteDescription) {
                 _rtc.pc.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.videoSwitchAnswer)) ...
             }
         }

     The `!_rtc.pc.currentRemoteDescription` guard is copy-pasted from the
     ORIGINAL call-setup answer listener (line 3177), where it correctly
     means "we haven't applied an answer yet." But a voice→video switch only
     ever happens on an ALREADY-CONNECTED call — `pc.currentRemoteDescription`
     has been non-null since the very first handshake and never becomes null
     again. So this guard is permanently false the moment a call is live,
     `setRemoteDescription()` is never called on the renegotiated answer, and
     the RTCPeerConnection stays stuck in signalingState 'have-local-offer'
     forever. The requester's own video track was already added and shown
     locally (which is why the requester's own camera preview can look like
     it "worked" for a split second) — but neither side's connection ever
     finishes the video renegotiation, so no video actually flows either way.
     That matches exactly: consent accepted, answer sent back, video never
     appears.

   WHY THIS PATCH CAN'T JUST EDIT THAT LINE:
     `_rtc` is a variable private to app-patch-openchat.js's own closure —
     it is never exposed on `window`, so no later-loaded file can reach in
     and flip that one guard directly. Instead, this patch fixes it from
     the outside using the same two hooks every browser exposes regardless
     of closures: the RTCPeerConnection constructor and the Firestore call
     doc both parties already write to.

   FIX:
     1. Wrap `window.RTCPeerConnection` (once) so every peer connection this
        page creates is also handed to a small tracker here — a transparent
        wrapper; every real instance is 100% the native object, so nothing
        else in the app (instanceof checks, method calls) can tell the
        difference.
     2. Watch each tracked connection's signalingstatechange. The ORIGINAL
        call handshake also passes through 'have-local-offer' once (on
        whichever side placed the original call) — so only signal on a
        *second* transition into 'have-local-offer', and only once the
        connection has already reported connectionState 'connected' at
        least once (i.e. the call was already live, which is exactly what
        distinguishes a video-switch renegotiation from the original
        handshake, and holds true regardless of which side — original
        caller or original callee — is the one requesting the switch).
     3. At that point, look up this user's currently-active call doc
        (`calls` where participants array-contains me, status 'active') and
        attach a small dedicated listener for `videoSwitchAnswer`. The
        moment it appears, apply it directly:
        `pc.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer))` —
        completing the exact step app-patch-openchat.js's own broken guard
        was blocking. Once applied, `pc.signalingState` naturally leaves
        'have-local-offer', so this can't double-apply even though the
        listener stays attached until the call ends.
     No existing behavior is touched — this only ever fires in the specific
     stuck state described above, and does nothing on every other call.

/* =============================================================================
   REV.4 ADDITIONS (same file, no new patch — per standing instruction not
   to keep spawning new patch files):

   A) RECENT CHAT NOT SORTED TO THE TOP
      renderContactList() (app-chat.js) builds rows in whatever order
      followedUserIds/mockUsers happen to iterate in — never by recency.
      _v36FixContactPreviews now also sorts .contact-item rows by the same
      chats/{chatId}.lastMessageTime this file already fetches for the
      preview text (rev.2/rev.3 above), most-recent first, re-running the
      sort both on every render pass and immediately whenever a live
      onSnapshot update lands (so a new incoming message jumps that
      contact to the top right away, not just on the next re-render).
      Only reorders .contact-item nodes — #v14-groups-section, #v20's
      broadcasts section, the search box and the tab bar are untouched.

   B) TWO HEADERS SHOWING AT ONCE ("white" one above the blue one)
      Root cause: app-fixes.js's #nav-breadcrumb (~line 13527) — a small
      "🏠 Messages" desktop-style breadcrumb — is inserted above EVERY
      section on navigation and is never scoped to hide anywhere. It was
      never "a second Messages header" by design, it's a leftover
      desktop-nav aid that happens to render right above
      app-patch-openchat.js's own blue #oc-cl-header on the Messages
      section specifically. Per instruction, this is now hidden outright
      (not shifted/covered) via body.oc-in-messages #nav-breadcrumb —
      reusing app-patch-openchat.js's own existing "Messages section is
      visible" signal — leaving the blue #oc-cl-header as the only header.

   C) "PREMIUM THUMBNAIL" FOR THE (NOW ONLY) BLUE HEADER
      #oc-cl-header was still flat #1B2B8B with plain white text — it
      never got the gradient/gold-hairline/glass-chip-button treatment
      already applied to the single-chat header (#oc-chat-header) earlier
      in this file. Re-skinned to match, via !important where needed to
      win over #oc-cl-header's inline style set at creation time.

                       again, even minutes later once auth had fully
                       settled. That's a regression the 2026-08-13 fix
                       introduced: before it, every renderContactList()
                       pass re-attempted every listener with no memory of
                       past failures, so a transient denial eventually
                       cleared itself; after it, the FIRST denial for a
                       given contact is now permanent for the rest of the
                       page session. Only self-heal on permission-denied
                       specifically (the transient-token case) — leave the
                       entry in place, unmodified, for any other error, so
                       a genuine, persistent authorization problem still
                       only logs once instead of retrying forever. */
