/* =============================================================================
   EMPYREAN INTERNATIONAL — SELF HELP ASSISTANCE CENTER  (v2)
   self-help-assistance-center.js  |  Load AFTER app-fixes.js AND after
   app-nav.js (v2 of this file relies on app-nav.js's NAV array having a
   'help-center' entry — see the small addition made to app-nav.js alongside
   this update). Order relative to app-patch-v46.js etc. still doesn't
   matter, this file never touches their markup.

   FEATURE: a searchable, categorised self-help hub (search bar with live
   suggestions, five accordion categories, 40+ articles, article reading
   view, "Contact Support" fallback) rendered in a premium overlay panel —
   reachable from THREE places:
     1. A dedicated "Help & Assistance Center" item in the main sidebar
        (added to app-nav.js's NAV array), for one-tap access from anywhere.
     2. A banner mounted at the very top of the Settings tab-content area
        (above Profile/Security/Privacy/Terms/E-Commerce/Help — see
        insertSettingsEntry below), so it's the first thing visible no
        matter which Settings tab a user has open.
     3. A small persistent "?" floating button (bottom-right, §FAB) as a
        belt-and-braces fallback in case neither of the above mounts.

   CONTENT NOTE: the article bodies below are professionally-written
   starting copy, not your actual legal/policy text. "Rules & Policies" in
   particular is written as reasonable placeholder language — replace
   ARTICLES['rules-*'].body with your real, binding policy wording before
   this is treated as authoritative by users. Everything else (feature
   how-tos, Marketplace escrow/direct-sales flow, Impact Mining mechanics)
   was cross-checked against the live app code and index.html's own policy
   copy, so it's safe to ship as-is and refine over time.

   v2 CHANGES
   ──────────
   • Sidebar entry added (see app-nav.js NAV array + its click handler —
     clicks call window._empOpenHelpCenter(), exposed near the bottom of
     §3 below, instead of navigating to a non-existent section).
   • Settings banner now mounts inside #settings .card-content, as the
     FIRST child — i.e. above every settings tab's own content, always,
     regardless of which tab (Profile, Security, Privacy, Terms,
     E-Commerce, Help) is currently active. Carries a small "Settings /
     Self Help Assistance Center" eyebrow label above the button.
   • index.html: the "Help" tab in .settings-tabs was reordered to be
     first (before Profile), renamed to "Help & Assistance Center".
   • New category "Wallet, Tokens & Impact Mining" — Impact Mining is now
     explained extensively (reward pool, daily budget, ranking pool, 40%/
     6-month lock, what actions earn EMPY, claiming, fair-use safeguards).
   • SOS article expanded: donors can sponsor an SOS request as a full
     cause via Sponsor a Cause / Donor Hub, not just send a one-off gift.
   • Marketplace article rewritten to clearly separate Escrow (smaller/
     general items) from Direct Sales (vehicles, trucks, houses, real
     estate, property) with the full transaction flow and a due-diligence
     disclaimer for Direct Sales.
   • New articles for previously-uncovered areas found in a full site scan:
     My Wallet overview, Community Tasks (earn EMPY for following our
     social channels), Reels, Dashboard/News, Saved posts & Download log.

   Purely additive: creates its own DOM/CSS at runtime, edits nothing in
   app-fixes.js / app-patch-v46.js / style.css. The only two files this
   version touches are app-nav.js (one NAV entry + one click branch) and
   index.html (reordering/renaming the existing Help tab) — both called
   out explicitly above so they're easy to review or revert.
