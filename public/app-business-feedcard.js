   EMPYREAN INTERNATIONAL — BUSINESS PAGE FEED CARD
   app-business-feedcard.js  |  v1.5  |  New standalone module

   PURPOSE
   ───────
   Renders interactive "Business Page" cards directly inside the Community
   Feed (#feed-container), per spec:

     • Collapsed state: business header (logo, name) + a horizontally
       scrollable row of product thumbnails (image, name, price) + a
       "Visit Business Page" button + Like/Comment/Share action bar.
     • Expanded state: clicking any product opens a full-screen modal with
       a header (logo, name, cover) and a 2-column product grid (image,
       name, price), the same "Visit Business Page" CTA, and the same
       action bar.
     • Clicking "Visit Business Page" navigates to that business's full
       page via the existing window.navigateTo / window.renderBusinessPage
       pipeline already used elsewhere in the app.
     • A Follow button sits in the header of both the collapsed card and
       the expanded modal (next to the page name), letting any signed-in
       user follow/unfollow that business. Backed by a `followers` array
       on business_pages/{pageId} in Firestore; see the FOLLOW section
       below for details, including a reusable renderBizFollowButton()
       helper exposed on window for other modules to drop into their own
       business-page header markup.
     • Card SET: every business page with at least one product gets its
       own card; all of them sit side-by-side inside one horizontally
       swipeable wrapper (.biz-feedcard-set) so users can swipe between
       different businesses' product arrays, rather than only ever seeing
       a single "most recently active" business.

   WHY A STANDALONE MODULE
   ────────────────────────
   The main feed's regular post-card template (".impact-story") is built by
   a module not present in this patch set, so this card is intentionally
   self-contained: its own builder, its own positioning logic, its own
   modal. It only needs to find #feed-container and insert itself as a
   sibling — it never reads or depends on the unknown template.

   PLACEMENT
   ─────────
   Spec: "Posts → Business Page card(s) → More posts" — the card set must
   sit in the MIDDLE of the feed, never first, never last. A
   MutationObserver watches #feed-container and re-positions the set after
   the 3rd real post (".impact-story") any time the feed's post count
   changes, so it stays mid-feed as new posts stream in (matches the
   existing live-feed pattern already used by app-feed.js / app-fixes.js
   for SOS and crisis cards).

   DATA SOURCE
   ───────────
   business_posts documents (written by app-business.js submitBusinessPost).
   Each post now carries a `products` array — { url, isVideo, name, price }
   — one entry per uploaded media item, in addition to the existing `media`
   array (kept for backward compatibility with older renderers). This module
   groups posts by pageId and builds ONE card per business page that has at
   least one usable product, sorted by most recently active first, with
   every product from that business's recent posts feeding its thumbnail
   row / expanded grid.

   LIKE / COMMENT / SHARE
   ───────────────────────
   Reuses the exact markup contract already wired up globally by
   app-fix-final.js §45 (universal like/share) — class="biz-post-card",
   data-collection="business_posts", data-post-id, and the same
   .action-btn.like-btn / .comment-btn / .action-btn.share-btn structure
   used by app-business.js's _buildBizPostCard(). Like/share are wired up
   automatically by §45's delegated handlers; comment-btn is wired by this
   module's own delegated handler further down, which opens the full-screen
   comment thread panel built earlier in this file.

       PRICE-VISIBILITY RULE — NGOs / service-rendering organisations don't
       show listing prices; product-selling businesses (retail, real estate,
       automotive, etc.) do.

       This codebase doesn't have a field literally called `organizationType`
       — the equivalent that already exists is the 7-way category system in
       app-business.js §3.5 (BIZ_CATEGORY_ORDER: ngo/bank/government/
       international/oilgas/service/product, resolved from a business_pages
       doc via window._bizResolveCategory()). This reuses that resolver
       rather than adding a second, parallel category concept.

       `business_posts` docs (what this feed card actually renders from)
       don't carry `category`/`industry` themselves — only the
       `business_pages` doc does — so the full page doc is looked up from
       window._firestoreBusinessPages (the same page-data cache
       _visitBusinessPage() below already reads) by pageId. If that page
       isn't in cache yet and no usable fallback object is passed either,
       this resolves to '' → _hidePriceForCategory('') is false, i.e. the
       price still shows. That's a deliberate fail-open: silently hiding a
       real price because the category couldn't be resolved would be a
       worse surprise than occasionally showing one it shouldn't. */

       media[] when a post has no products[], treating each media URL as a

       later call — from the feed's MutationObserver, section-change
       events, and the periodic safety interval in _watchFeed() — hit the
       "already cached" short-circuit below and just re-served that stale
       snapshot instead of asking Firestore again. That first fetch runs
       ~1-2s after app init, i.e. before a user could plausibly have
       created a business page and published a product in the same
       session — so anything posted afterward silently never showed up,
       with no error and no reload fixing it either (a reload just repeats
       the same one-shot-then-freeze pattern with fresh timing).

       Fixed by switching to a live onSnapshot listener (mirrors the
       pattern already used elsewhere in this app, e.g. the old dashboard
       business-posts slider): the cache now updates itself the moment a
       new business_posts document is written, and every update re-runs
       _placeCard() so a freshly published product appears within moments
       — no reload required. The listener is started once (guarded by

           Every previous attempt used a flex column whose total height was
           set to some computed viewport value. Flex layout on mobile WebViews
           has proven unreliable: the composer always ends up pushed off the
           bottom of the screen regardless of how the height is computed.

           This version abandons flex entirely for the overlay itself.
           The overlay is position:fixed, inset 0 (fills the screen).
           Inside it, three children are each position:absolute with
           explicit top/bottom pixel coordinates:
             • header  — top:0,   height:HEADER_H px
             • list    — top:HEADER_H, bottom:COMPOSER_H px, overflow-y:scroll
             • composer — bottom:0, height:COMPOSER_H px
           No flexbox height calculation, no vh/dvh units, no JS pixel
           measurement needed. The browser's own layout engine handles the
           rest and the composer is ALWAYS at the bottom of the screen. */

           visible area — it excludes the browser address bar AND the
           browser nav bar at the bottom. Combined with visualViewport.offsetTop
           we can pin the overlay exactly to the visible screen region.

       nearest .biz-post-card, reads its data-post-id, and opens the same

           call _placeCard() again after the very first attempt — so if

           the card would never get a second chance even though the

           have the data. This periodic safety net re-checks a few times
