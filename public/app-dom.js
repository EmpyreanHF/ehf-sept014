        // cold/uncached page load can easily still be in flight at this

        // useful error for the person to act on.

        // poor/rural connection, a phone-recorded video (routinely
        // 1080p-4K, tens of MB) is by far the heaviest thing this app ever
        // asks someone to upload, and it was passing through completely
        // untouched. This shrinks it BEFORE upload when doing so actually
        // helps, using only browser-native APIs (<video> + <canvas> +
        // MediaRecorder) — no new library, no WASM download, nothing that
        // costs bandwidth or adds a heavy dependency for a low-end device.
        //
        // WHEN IT DOES NOTHING (fails safe to the original file, untouched):
        //   - Browser lacks canvas.captureStream()/MediaRecorder support,
        //     or no MediaRecorder mimeType is supported at all.
        //   - The source is already at or below the target resolution
        //     (TARGET_MAX_DIM below) — this app's own video players
        //     (app-feed.js's .story-video etc.) are always rendered at
        //     `width:100%` of a phone-width container, so a source already
        //     at or under that never benefits from being re-encoded, and
        //     re-encoding an already-small file would just add a
        //     pointless quality-losing extra generation for no size win.
        //   - The clip is longer than MAX_DURATION_S. This technique
        //     re-encodes in REAL TIME (it plays the video while re-
        //     recording it — MediaRecorder has no faster-than-realtime
        //     mode in-browser), so compressing a long video would cost
        //     roughly its own runtime in CPU time on the person's device
        //     before the upload even starts. Fine for short-form content
        //     (reels/status clips); not worth it for a longer upload,
        //     which now just uploads at original size/quality instead.
        //   - The compressed result somehow ends up LARGER than the
        //     original (rare, but possible for an already-efficient short
        //     clip) — same "never make it worse" rule _compressImage()
        //     already follows.
        //   - Anything throws, or the whole attempt exceeds a hard safety
        //     timeout (duration-based, capped) — always resolves with the
        //     ORIGINAL file rather than rejecting, so a compression bug
        //     can never be the reason an upload fails outright.
        //
        // QUALITY: only ever downscales resolution DOWN to what this app's
        // own player actually renders (never up, never past the source's
        // own resolution), and only re-encodes when that downscale is
        // real. Audio is passed through as its own untouched track (not
        // re-encoded from a lossy decode — captured directly from the
        // source <video> element's own audio track), so there's no audio
        // quality loss at all, only ever a video one, and only when the
        // source was larger than what anyone actually sees.

        // typically the form itself, right below the file input/submit
        // button. Safe to call attach() multiple times on the same
        // container (e.g. multi-file loops) — each call reuses the same
        // bar node for that container rather than stacking duplicates.

           FEATURE (2026-09-12) — CONTENT CONTROL: BLOCK + RESTRICT MEDIA
           =========================================================================
           "Post restrictions" (block/filter posts from selected contacts) and
           "Media restrictions" (WhatsApp-style: hide a contact's media by
           default without fully blocking them) from this session's project
           spec. Two independent per-viewer lists, both stored ONLY on the
           viewer's own users/{uid} doc (arrayUnion/arrayRemove — the exact
           same Firestore write pattern already used everywhere else in this
           codebase, e.g. retweetedBy in app-fixes.js) so this is purely a
           "what I don't want to see" setting, never a moderation action
           against the other account and never written to THEIR doc:
             • blockedUserIds       — that contact's posts/status are hidden
               from my feed/status bar entirely (checked in app-feed.js's
               posts onSnapshot listener and app-status.js's renderStatusBar).
             • restrictedMediaUserIds — that contact's posts/status still
               show (text, likes, etc.) but their MEDIA is hidden behind a
               tap-to-reveal placeholder (checked in
               createNewPostElement's mediaHTML build and app-status.js's
               status-bar thumbnail).
           Both lists live on userState as Sets (see the loadUserFromFirestore
           conversion just above) for fast, synchronous .has() checks from
           render code — exactly how likedPostIds/followedUserIds etc.
           already work — and are mirrored to Firestore in the background so
           they survive reload/other devices. Exposed on window so every
           module (app-feed.js, app-status.js, app-fixes.js's delegated
           click handler, the Settings > Privacy panel) can call them without
           a new shared-state file. */
